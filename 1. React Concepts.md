# React Concepts
### *Benefits of React*
 - You can build Web Interfaces without touching the DOM (Declarative approach)
 - React is Component based. Components are represented as Javascript functions or classes, that can e reusable.
 - React renders based on the state change. When a component is changed, React changes only the component itself, but not the entire DOM itself.
 - React has one basic concept about components and states and you can implement this concept on the browser, mobile, etc.

*In **index.js***

        ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
        // It takes element with id 'root' and replace it with what isinside App.js
Inside React App we have a Babel file, which help our js files to be compilable with all browsers
state - Javascript object with properties which we can access in JSX
{} -anything between thisbracketsis javascript expression
this.setState - is part of React flow, when we call this method and there is change in state, React compares Virtual DOM with DOM and if there is difference, JSX is beign rerendered.

When we iterate an array in JSX, we need to specify a unique key onevery element. That is becouse 

React needs to know which element to update when there is a change to the state.

props.children - is anything you insert inside the parent component

      <CardList name="Yhua"> // props.name
        <h1>Hello</h1> // props.children
      </CardList>


## Lifecycle Methods
componentDidMount - when the component renders for the first time

Class Component - you can state property and make more dynamic and complexcomponents
Functional Component - used for static JSX, because doesn't have a state property 

If we use this context inside a newly created function declaration, we need to specify the context inside the contructor of the class component or use arrow functions

    this.handleChange  =  this.handleChange.bind(this);

If we declare an arrow function in the global scope of the browser, we will get the window object as result of logging this keyword. That is because the arrow functions doesn't have this context set inside them.

    const newFunc = () => console.log(this);

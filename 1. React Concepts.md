# React Concepts
### *Benefits of React*
 - You can build Web Interfaces without touching the DOM (Declarative approach)
 - React is Component based. Components are represented as Javascript functions or classes, that can e reusable.
 - React renders based on the state change. When a component is changed, React changes only the component itself, but not the entire DOM itself.
 - React has one basic concept about components and states and you can implement this concept on the browser, mobile, etc.

*In **index.js***

        ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
        // It takes element with id 'root' and replace it with what isinside App.js
Inside React App we have a Babel file, which help our js files to be compilable with all browsers
state - Javascript object with properties which we can access in JSX
{} -anything between thisbracketsis javascript expression
this.setState - is part of React flow, when we call this method and there is change in state, React compares Virtual DOM with DOM and if there is difference, JSX is beign rerendered.

When we iterate an array in JSX, we need to specify a unique key onevery element. That is becouse 

React needs to know which element to update when there is a change to the state.

props.children - is anything you insert inside the parent component

      <CardList name="Yhua"> // props.name
        <h1>Hello</h1> // props.children
      </CardList>


## Lifecycle Methods
componentDidMount - when the component renders for the first time, the component is mounted once and then if there is changes it starts to update
componentDidUpdate - triggers when there is change in state
shouldComponentUpdate - decides whether to update the components or not
componentWillUnmount - the phase when the components that we dont't use gets unmounted

    shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    	// it holds the values of the new props and states and if they aren't the same it updates the  component
    	return nextProps.text !== this.props.text;
    }

Class Component - you can state property and make more dynamic and complexcomponents
Functional Component - used for static JSX, because doesn't have a state property 

If we use this context inside a newly created function declaration, we need to specify the context inside the contructor of the class component or use arrow functions

    this.handleChange  =  this.handleChange.bind(this);

If we declare an arrow function in the global scope of the browser, we will get the window object as result of logging this keyword. That is because the arrow functions doesn't have this context set inside them.

    const newFunc = () => console.log(this);

package-lock.json - means that the dependencies are locked to the current version you see in package.json

npm list react react-dom react-scripts - you can see the latest version of react

Virtual is Copy of actual DOM in javascript. Of there is any change, React will compare it with the real DOM and update only this change, but not the whole DOM

To see what is beign rerendered in the DOM when you type something, go to Dev tools > Theree Dots(More) > More Tools > Rendering, then enable paint flashing in the Rendering tab below

this.setState is asynchronous functions, so if we want to be sure the actual state is rendered, we can use it like this

    this.setState((prevState, prevProps) => {
    	return { meaningOfLife: prevState.meaningOfLife + 1 }
    })

 
If you ever want to use props inside of a constructor, you must use it like this

    constructor(props) {
    	this.state = {
	    	meaningOfLife: 47
    	}
	    this.props = props
    }
If we dont't use constructor, we can initialize state as a field in the class

    state = {
    	meaningOfLife: 47
    }
